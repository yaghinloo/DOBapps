DOB applications

In this code i have implemented the following logic
1- read the latest data from the NYC DOB API server and store it to DB
2- read the Data from DB and create a table with the content
3- clean up the table header names from extra character like '_'

JS code :
code is written in ES6 and transpiled using babel.
I have used UMD standard to bring the AMD and CJS standards as well as normal script tag.

Libraries :
I have used jQuery for loading Json and
